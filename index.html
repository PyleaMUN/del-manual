    <p><span class="bold">What is Model United Nations?</span></p>

    <p>Model United Nations (Model UN or MUN) is an academic simulation of the United Nations in which students take on the roles of delegates representing various countries. Their goal is to address and resolve global issues by debating, negotiating, and collaborating---while faithfully reflecting the policies and viewpoints of their assigned nation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="bold">What Should Delegates Do Before the Conference?</span></p>
      <p>This section outlines all the essential steps you need to take as you prepare for PyleaMUN. We strongly recommend that you complete your preparation at least two weeks prior to the start of the conference, ensuring you are fully ready to participate effectively and confidently.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">1. Choosing a Committee</span></p>
      <p>Before attending PyleaMUN, you must first decide which committee you would like to join. Review the conference agenda carefully and select the committee and topic that interests you most. Your engagement and enthusiasm during the sessions often reflect how connected you feel to the topic.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">2. Conducting Research</span></p>
      <p>Every delegate is expected to conduct thorough research before the conference. This includes understanding the topics on the agenda and knowing your assigned country's stance on those issues. Informed delegates make impactful contributions to the debate.</p>
      <p><span class="bold italic">Here's how to approach your research:</span></p>
      <p><span class="bold">a) Understand the Country You Represent</span></p>
      <p>Start by creating a <span class="bold">Country Profile</span>. You'll need a clear understanding of your country's geography, government, history, economy, foreign relations, and demographics. Consider the following questions to guide you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is your country's official name?</li>
        <li>Where in the world is it located?</li>
        <li>What are its size and population?</li>
        <li>Who are its neighboring countries?</li>
        <li>What is its geographical and climatic profile?</li>
        <li>What is the country's history and founding date?</li>
        <li>What form of government does it have?</li>
        <li>Who are its allies and adversaries?</li>
        <li>What is the capital city and its significance?</li>
        <li>What is the ethnic composition and official language?</li>
        <li>How would you assess the quality of life?</li>
        <li>What is its GDP and major economic sectors?</li>
        <li>What are its key natural resources?</li>
        <li>What are its main imports and exports?</li>
        <li>Who are its primary trade partners?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="bold">b) Research the Background of Your Topic</span></p>
      <p>Gain a foundational understanding of the issue you'll be discussing. Define key terms and explore the topic's origins, causes, and global impact. Questions to consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the issue about?</li>
        <li>What are its root causes?</li>
        <li>Who is affected and how?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="italic">Note:</span> Study guides will be made available on the PyleaMUN website a few months before the conference. However, these are a starting point---your own independent research is essential.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">c) Understand Your Country's Policy</span></p>
      <p>You are not representing your personal opinion, but rather the official stance of your assigned country. Make sure you understand your country's interests and priorities on the issue, and be prepared to defend them during the debates.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">d) Stay Updated on Recent Developments</span></p>
      <p>Research current events related to your topic. Being aware of the latest developments allows you to bring relevance and credibility to your arguments.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">e) Explore Past International Actions</span></p>
      <p>Review what has already been done at the international level to address the issue. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>UN resolutions</li>
        <li>International treaties and conventions</li>
        <li>Actions by NGOs and intergovernmental organizations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding the history of international response helps you evaluate what has worked, what hasn't, and what gaps remain.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">f) Develop Possible Solutions</span></p>
      <p>This is perhaps the most important part of your preparation. Remember, the goal of MUN is to create realistic, practical, and effective resolutions. Think about what your country would support and propose as a solution---either domestically or globally. Creativity is encouraged, but your ideas must be achievable and align with your country's policy.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Policy Statement</span></p>

    <p>The policy statement is a concise speech summarizing your understanding of the topic while clearly outlining your country's policy. It should include background information on your country's position, its current stance, and its desired outcomes related to the issue at hand. The statement must not exceed one minute in length and will be presented at the start of the lobbying session.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="bold italic">Sample Policy Statement</span></p>
      <p><span class="italic">Topic: Safeguarding the rights of refugees Proposed by: Ethiopia</span></p>
      <p><span class="italic">The government of Ethiopia maintains an open door policy on the issue of refugees and continues to allow humanitarian access and protection to those seeking refuge on its territory. More than 630,000 refugees are accommodated, mainly in camps, throughout the country. However, provisions under Ethiopian law for refugees' local integration are very limited. The country participated in the 1951 Convention, but maintains reservations regarding refugees' employment (Article 17 of the Convention). Yet, it supports an out-of-camp scheme that allows refugees to live outside camps and engage in informal livelihood opportunities. In addition, an all-out effort is being exerted to provide education to as many refugees as possible. Also, Ethiopia took part on the 1969 OAU Convention, governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in the African region. Last but not least, considering that Ethiopia is a less economically developed country, she is making all efforts and cooperates with international organizations in order to safeguard the rights of refugees, IDPs and asylum seekers.</span></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="underline">Draft Resolution</span></p>

    <p>Once you have completed all the previous steps, you will need to prepare a draft resolution. This document outlines the proposed actions your country believes will effectively address the issue. You are expected to bring this draft to the conference and aim to have as many of your clauses as possible included in the final resolution. The resolution consists of three main sections and must follow a specific format.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Heading</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="bold">FORUM:</span> (your Committee)</p>
      <p><span class="bold">QUESTION OF:</span> (your topic)</p>
      <p><span class="bold">SUBMITTED BY:</span> (your country)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>2. Preambulatory clauses</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>These clauses form the introduction of the resolution and provide context and background on the issue being addressed. Each clause begins with a preambulatory phrase and ends with a comma. They are not open to debate. Preambulatory clauses may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>References to previous UN resolutions, treaties, or conventions relevant to the topic</li>
        <li>Citations from the UN Charter or other international laws and frameworks</li>
        <li>Statements from the Secretary-General or other UN bodies and agencies</li>
        <li>Key facts, historical context, and the significance or impact of the issue</li>
        <li>Examples of past efforts at the national, regional, or non-governmental level to resolve the issue</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="bold">3. Operative Clauses</span></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>These clauses outline the specific actions and solutions your country proposes. Each operative clause must be numbered and conclude with a semicolon (;), except for the final clause, which ends with a period (.).</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Resolutions must not include specific financial amounts</span>, though they may mention potential sources of funding in general terms.</p>

    <p>What is done during the Conference?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="bold">In Brief: Committee Procedure</span></p>
      <p>1. Each committee is overseen by a Main Chair or President, along with two Co-Chairs or Deputy Presidents, who are responsible for guiding the discussions. The session begins with a Roll Call to take attendance.</p>
      <p>2. The committee then enters the Lobbying phase, during which delegates form alliances and submit their final draft resolutions.</p>
      <p>3. Once approved by the Approval Panel, each draft resolution is discussed and debated one at a time.</p>
      <p>4. Delegates have the opportunity to submit amendments to the draft resolutions.</p>
      <p>5. After the time allocated for closed debate on each amendment, delegates will vote on them. Following the open debate on a resolution, a vote will be held on the resolution as a whole. This process will be repeated for each submitted draft resolution until all have been addressed.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="bold">LOBBYING</span></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The lobbying process is a crucial stage in every MUN conference, as it is when the final draft resolutions are developed. At PyleaMUN, lobbying will take place on the second day of the conference.</p>
      <p>During this phase, delegates are free to move around the room, collaborate, and negotiate with others to form alliances and work towards a consensus---always keeping their country's policy in mind. This is the time to express your views, draft clauses, and build support for your ideas. A resolution requires signatures from at least one-third of the committee's members, and each delegate may sign only one resolution per topic.</p>
      <p>Your goal is to convince other delegates that your clauses are effective so they are included in the final draft resolution---and ideally, to become the <span class="bold">Main Submitter</span> of the resolution. Success in lobbying comes from being proactive: presenting your proposals, initiating discussions, and leading coalition-building efforts.</p>
      <p>Chairs will oversee the lobbying process to ensure productive collaboration. Once an alliance finalizes its draft resolution (at least one member should have a laptop), it must be formatted according to official guidelines (see page 8) and submitted to the <span class="bold">Chairs</span> for review. The Chairs will address policy-related issues, while the <span class="bold">Approval Panel</span>, will check formatting, grammar, and spelling. Note: The <span class="bold">Main Submitter</span> does not participate in the approval process. Once approved, the draft resolution is ready for debate.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="bold">DEBATE PROCEDURE</span></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Debate is the stage where all draft resolutions are formally discussed. Your objective is to persuade the committee to vote in favor of your resolution.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">PyleaMUN follows an open debate format for resolutions</span>, meaning any delegate, once recognized by the Chair, may speak either in favor of or against the entire resolution. In contrast, <span class="bold">closed debate is used for amendments</span>, with designated time for arguments for and against each amendment.</p>
      <p>Once lobbying concludes, the Chair will announce the beginning of the debate. Each resolution is given a specific time limit, which may be extended by the Chair if needed. The Admin Staff will circulate copies of the first resolution to all delegates. The <span class="bold">Main Submitter</span> will then read the operative clauses aloud and deliver an opening speech in support of the resolution.</p>
      <p>Other delegates may take the floor to express support or opposition. After speaking, a delegate may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yield time to <span class="bold">questions and answers</span></li>
        <li>Yield to <span class="bold">another delegate</span></li>
        <li>Yield to <span class="bold">the Chair</span></li>
        <li>Or declare <span class="bold">no yield</span>: in this case, two delegates will each be granted 30 seconds to make comments on the speech or the topic raised.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="bold">AMENDMENTS</span></p>

    <p>Delegates can also propose amendments, or changes, to the resolution. Once debate time on an amendment or resolution ends, the committee proceeds to the voting procedure. Delegates vote by raising their placards to indicate "in favor," "against," or "abstain." Co-submitters are not obligated to vote in favor of the resolution---they are simply supporting its discussion Amendments</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Amendments are used to modify draft resolutions. An amendment is a written proposal that adds, removes, or alters an <span class="bold">operative clause</span> (note: <span class="bold">preambulatory clauses cannot be amended</span>). The purpose of amendments is to build broader consensus by refining the resolution's content.</p>
      <p>The Chair decides when amendments will be discussed. Once an amendment is proposed, the Chair will read it aloud slowly and clearly so that all delegates can take note.</p>
